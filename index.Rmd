This workshop is organised into a number of semi-independant modules;

1) [Setup](00_Setup.html) : Load a preprocessed dataset, and libraries needed for the analysis.
2) [Explore](01_Explore.html) : Inspect the dataset - what does it look like?
3) [Differential Expression: By Celltype](02_DE_by_celltype.html) : What genes are expressed differently between conditions, in different celltypes.
4) [Differential Expression: By Niche](03_DE_by_niche.html) : Define different tissue niches by regional gene expressesion; Then identify genes that change in these regions by condition.
5) [Differential Expression: By localisation](04_DE_by_localisation.html): What genes are expressed differently when a celltype is localised in different tissue niches?
6) [Celltype co-occurances](05_celltype_cooccurance.html) : Do celltypes co-localise with other celltypes, in a manner than changes with condition?
