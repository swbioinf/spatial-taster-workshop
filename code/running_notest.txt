NOTES FOR RUNNING WORKSHOP


1) 00_Setup.Rmd will set up the R environment for any of the subsequent activities (they're all indepedentant)


2) 
Trying to open an SFE object twice will yeild an error. (Expect this to occur). 

Error in `H5Fopen()`:
! HDF5. File accessibility. Unable to open file.

To fix
1. clear environment
2. restart R
3. Run 00_setup.Rmd


3) There is a .backups directory, but I forgot to populatet it. If the object gets broken/overwritten we'll need to get a new VM (this shouldn't happen, there's no saving steps.)
